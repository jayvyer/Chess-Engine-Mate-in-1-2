## To-Do

-   [ ] Read the [instructions](proj1.pdf).
-   [ ] Add function implementations to [io.c](io.c), [main.c](main.c), and [moves.c](moves.c).
-   [ ] Do testing in [main.c](main.c) to test each of your function implementations.
-   [ ] Additionally, you can use [librefimpl.so](librefimpl.so) and [test.c](test.c) to get the correct output for any inputs you want to test.
-   [ ] When you are done with your work, all members of your team should make a submission on MyCourses with the 7-digit SHA hash of the commit you want graded as the submission's comment.
-   [ ] Sample test cases: [m2_5k.txt](m2_5k.txt)
_Do not upload any files using MyCourses!_

## How to compile and run your code
1. Compile your project  
```bash
bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD
make all
```
2. Run your project  
```bash
./chess puzzles.txt solution.txt <mode>
```

3. Run test, make sure you have already set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` using `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD`
```bash
./test <input>
```
For example: `./test "r3k2K/pppp4/8/8/8/8/p7/8 b q -"`


## Grading

-   Your grade will be recorded on MyCourses
-   After grading is complete, you will find a commit from one of the TAs that adds the following files:
    -   test.c
    -   test.sh
    -   results.log
